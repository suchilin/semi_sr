The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n   function foundBooks(books) {\n   }\n   function failure(reason) {\n   }\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      try {\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n          } else {\n            try {\n              foundBooks(books);\n            } catch(reason) {\n              failure(reason);\n            }\n          }\n        });\n      } catch(error) {\n        failure(err);\n      }\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n   @method then\n  @param {Function} onFulfilled\n  @param {Function} onRejected\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n  */\n\n  /**\n  `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n  as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n  ```js\n  function findAuthor(){\n  throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n  }\n  // synchronous\n  try {\n  findAuthor();\n  } catch(reason) {\n  // something went wrong\n  }\n  // async with promises\n  findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n  // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n  @method catch\n  @param {Function} onRejection\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n  */\n\n\n  Promise.prototype.catch = function _catch(onRejection) {\n    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n  };\n\n  /**\n    `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n    try/catch/finally behaves\n  \n    Synchronous example:\n  \n    ```js\n    findAuthor() {\n      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n        throw new Error();\n      }\n      return new Author();\n    }\n  \n    try {\n      return findAuthor();

Including the modifiers like `asFlat`.\n * - utils/   Utility stuff.\n *\n */\nvar extras = {\n    allowStateChanges: allowStateChanges,\n    deepEqual: deepEqual,\n    getAtom: getAtom,\n    getDebugName: getDebugName,\n    getDependencyTree: getDependencyTree,\n    getAdministration: getAdministration,\n    getGlobalState: getGlobalState,\n    getObserverTree: getObserverTree,\n    interceptReads: interceptReads,\n    isComputingDerivation: isComputingDerivation,\n    isSpyEnabled: isSpyEnabled,\n    onReactionError: onReactionError,\n    reserveArrayBuffer: reserveArrayBuffer,\n    resetGlobalState: resetGlobalState,\n    isolateGlobalState: isolateGlobalState,\n    shareGlobalState: shareGlobalState,\n    spyReport: spyReport,\n    spyReportEnd: spyReportEnd,\n    spyReportStart: spyReportStart,\n    setReactionScheduler: setReactionScheduler\n};\nvar everything = {\n    Reaction: Reaction,\n    untracked: untracked,\n    Atom: Atom,\n    BaseAtom: BaseAtom,\n    useStrict: useStrict,\n    isStrictModeEnabled: isStrictModeEnabled,\n    spy: spy,\n    comparer: comparer,\n    asReference: asReference,\n    asFlat: asFlat,\n    asStructure: asStructure,\n    asMap: asMap,\n    isModifierDescriptor: isModifierDescriptor,\n    isObservableObject: isObservableObject,\n    isBoxedObservable: isObservableValue,\n    isObservableArray: isObservableArray,\n    ObservableMap: ObservableMap,\n    isObservableMap: isObservableMap,\n    map: map,\n    transaction: transaction,\n    observable: observable,\n    computed: computed,\n    isObservable: isObservable,\n    isComputed: isComputed,\n    extendObservable: extendObservable,\n    extendShallowObservable: extendShallowObservable,\n    observe: observe,\n    intercept: intercept,\n    autorun: autorun,\n    autorunAsync: autorunAsync,\n    when: when,\n    reaction: reaction,\n    action: action,\n    isAction: isAction,\n    runInAction: runInAction,\n    expr: expr,\n    toJS: toJS,\n    createTransformer: createTransformer,\n    whyRun: whyRun,\n    isArrayLike: isArrayLike,\n    extras: extras\n};\nvar warnedAboutDefaultExport = false;\nvar _loop_1 = function (p) {\n    var val = everything[p];\n    Object.defineProperty(everything, p, {\n        get: function () {\n            if (!warnedAboutDefaultExport) {\n                warnedAboutDefaultExport = true;\n                console.warn(\"Using default export (`import mobx from 'mobx'`) is deprecated \" +\n                    \"and won’t work in mobx@4.0.0\\n\" +\n                    \"Use `import * as mobx from 'mobx'` instead\");\n            }\n            return val;\n        }\n    });\n};\nfor (var p in everything) {\n    _loop_1(p);\n}\nif (typeof __MOBX_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ === \"object\") {\n    __MOBX_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__.injectMobx({ spy: spy, extras: extras });\n}\n\nexport { extras, Reaction, untracked, IDerivationState, Atom, BaseAtom, useStrict, isStrictModeEnabled, spy, comparer, asReference, asFlat, asStructure, asMap, isModifierDescriptor, isObservableObject, isObservableValue as isBoxedObservable, isObservableArray, ObservableMap, isObservableMap, map, transaction, observable, computed, isObservable, isComputed, extendObservable, extendShallowObservable, observe, intercept, autorun, autorunAsync, when, reaction, action, isAction, runInAction, expr, toJS, createTransformer, whyRun, trace, isArrayLike };export default everything;\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/mobx/lib/mobx.module.js\n// module id = 127\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n */\n\n'use strict';\n\nvar ReactPropTypesSecret = 'SECRET_DO_NOT_PASS_THIS_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED';\n\nmodule.exports = ReactPropTypesSecret;\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/prop-types/lib/ReactPropTypesSecret.js\n// module id = 128\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n *\n */\n\n'use strict';\n\nvar DOMLazyTree = require('./DOMLazyTree');\nvar Danger = require('./Danger');\nvar ReactDOMComponentTree = require('./ReactDOMComponentTree');\nvar ReactInstrumentation = require('./ReactInstrumentation');\n\nvar createMicrosoftUnsafeLocalFunction = require('./createMicrosoftUnsafeLocalFunction');\nvar setInnerHTML = require('./setInnerHTML');\nvar setTextContent = require('./setTextContent');\n\nfunction getNodeAfter(parentNode, node) {\n  // Special case for text components, which return [open, close] comments\n  // from getHostNode.\n  if (Array.isArray(node)) {\n    node = node[1];\n  }\n  return node ?

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm A fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `ENTERING`\n *  - `ENTERED`\n *  - `EXITING`\n *  - `EXITED`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state= { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) when finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, Transition);\n\n    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call(this, props, context));\n\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup;\n    // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?
